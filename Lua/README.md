dragcorpse.lua - pulls any corpse found nearby that is in your raid or group or youself, and drag it. Will stop dragging the corpse once the corpse is near a cleric in your group or raid.
Works best with two pullers running in chorus, if one goes down the other will grab the corpse of the dead puller and drag it back with them to the group and leave it near a cleric to be rezzed.


lootcorpse.lua - any corpse that belongs to your character will be summoned to you and looted.
Great for EMU servers where corpses do not disapear after rez.


guild-invite.lua - invites anyone currently online and in your dannet client to the guild of the character its ran on. Make sure this character has invite permissions.


mend.lua - uses mend anytime its up on your monk to help train it up.


feign.lua - spams feigndeath on your monk anytime its up to train it.
